### Preprocessor 
They are files of code  
They are just copy pasted into out code file

### How Compiler Works  
1. All preprocessor statement gets evaluated


### Linker
Linking multiple object files generated by compiling various source code files 
Linking error1: If the required file for eg Log() was not found 
Linking Error2: If the multiple functions and linker gets confused while linking to which fucn to link to  
    ( Techniques used to solve linking error2:  
    1. use static key word in front of the function   
    2. use inline key word in front of the function  
    )

#### Note:
Entry point need not be main function
